# Lambda.Overwatch

Started as an experiment first for me to learn AWS Lambda

## Serveless?

No, of course it runs on servers, just there's no point in paying for them all the time.

## Development

It's a bit awkward at the moment, I've taught myself so far using the AWS Web Interface, which isn't great, obviously.  Better way will be posted soon.

## Deployment

Very early days, as above, I just used the AWS Web Interface to begin with.

## Would you like to know more?

There's not much else for now I'm afraid.
